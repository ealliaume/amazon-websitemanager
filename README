This is a small Java project that uploads a directory of your choice to an Amazon S3 bucket with the option to clear the bucket prior to uploading.
It does so using sensible defaults for website serving (cache, acl, mime types), so that if the bucket is configured for website, it will work out of the box.

Available options:
- Without parameters, the system will use a basic GUI to ask for various required parameters.
- With parameter -Dbatch.path=<path>, will load a properties file located at <path> and work headlessly.
	Required properties are :
		<baseDirectory>=The directory from which to load the files on local filesystem (path as string)
		<bucketName>=The bucket which will receive the files (name as string)
	Optional properties are :
		<clearBucket>=Tell if the bucket will be emptied before uploading. Defaults to false. (boolean 'true' or 'false')

Features:
- Ignores dot files (usually hidden files under Unix or MacOS)
- Sets cache and expiry at sensible defaults
- Use 10 threads to speed up transfers and bucket clearing
